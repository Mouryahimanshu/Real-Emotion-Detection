# Realtime-Emotion-Detection
## Overview
#### ~ Real-Time Emotion Detection is an advanced machine learning project that analyzes facial expressions in real-time to classify emotions. Using deep learning models, the system can detect and categorize human emotions into seven classes: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. This project is particularly useful in applications such as sentiment analysis, user experience enhancement, and mental health monitoring.

## Features
*Real-Time Emotion Detection: Process live video streams or recorded videos to detect emotions instantly.*
Multiple Emotion Classes: Supports detection of seven different emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.
High Accuracy: Utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate emotion classification.
Easy to Use: Simple interface for running emotion detection on any webcam or video file.
Customizable: Easily fine-tune the model or integrate with other systems.
