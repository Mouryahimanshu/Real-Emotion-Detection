# Realtime-Emotion-Detection
## Overview
#### ~ Real-Time Emotion Detection is an advanced machine learning project that analyzes facial expressions in real-time to classify emotions. Using deep learning models, the system can detect and categorize human emotions into seven classes: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. This project is particularly useful in applications such as sentiment analysis, user experience enhancement, and mental health monitoring.
